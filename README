FactoryModule
=============

Here's an implementation of Factory pattern. Dispite the fact
that ruby is highly dynamic language and can happily live
without generative patters, I find it useful in some situations.
For example if some plugin wants to allow its users to subcalss
models which are instantiated somewhere inside it's codebase.
Using this pattern in such cases can help to avoid
'alias_method_chain' styled "hidden inheritance".


Example
=======

Please find a basic example in examples/visitors.rb
